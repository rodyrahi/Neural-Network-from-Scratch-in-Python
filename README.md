# Aartificial Neural Network Made from Scratch Using
This project involes creating a artificial neural network from scracth using python and using crossentropy loss function to do classifiation on a sentathic dataset , relu activation function is also being created from scratch and used in this project , also create a small framework like tensorflow that can create neural networks with multiple layers
